  I am passionate about mountain biking and social service. In December 2020 , I combined both my passions and went on a three day mountain biking trek in the northern Emirates to raise funds for a children's charity in Peru.
  The trek was organized by Gulf 4 Good(<a href="https://www.gulf4good.org/challenges/2020-cycle-the-eastern-emirates/" target="_Blank" style="color:blue"> Details of the trek  </a>) , a UAE based charity organization. During this trek , I slept on the mountains , cycled with fellow enthusiasts and developed a huge appreciation for nature and in giving back to the society.

  My passion for cycling and entrepreneurship made me realize that there was hardly any company in UAE concentrating on the tech side of cycling accessories. I researched a lot and eventually , I zeroed in on Smart Helmets , Smart Lights , Smart Locks , Smart Reflectors and Smart Gloves.
  This led me to create smartriderdubai.com retailing in smart tech cycling accessories. My father and myself applied and got the necessary local company registrations , developed the website , wrote to the manufacturers , imported the products and launched the B-C website.
